# Eternalizing Heritage, Art, and Culture: Heritage  Documentation Conservation Using An Indexed, Decentralized, and Redundant System of Human and Anthropogenic Networks 

Documentation records (hereinafter referred to simply as ‘documentation’) of heritage, art, and culture (hereinafter called ‘heritage entities’ and taken to include both tangible and intangible entities such as historical monuments and folk traditions for this article) play a crucial role in heritage conservation. These records are often stored/retained by centralized entities such as museums, national conservation agencies, remote web servers or government archives and records. Time and again, the grave problems inherent in such an approach to the conservation of heritage documentation has been evident when entire collections have been lost to disasters such as museum fires. The situation is even more serious when a heritage entity is destroyed without there being any documentation in the first place. The loss then is really totally irreplaceable. Entire cultural memories of regions and nations have been lost in this manner when they are, firstly, not documented, and secondly, if this documentation was not subsequently well-conserved. 


## Questioning heritage documentation approaches

The importance of documenting heritage using mechanisms specific to the heritage type cannot be overemphasized; in particular, the use of films, photography, and 3D tools is of utmost importance to ensure documentation that is as complete in its scope as possible. 

Experts around the world have been traditionally relying on drawings, notes, and field photographs for documentation but the use of multimedia and other modern techniques is of critical importance if a true reproduction of the heritage entity in a virtual form is to be obtained.  

Documentation, in the real sense of the word, can be deemed successful  only if the virtual representation of the heritage entity ‘captured’ (and referred to as the ‘documentation’ of the entity) covers (documents) as many aspects/facets of the entity as possible, stimulating as many sensory organs in the observer as possible while also attaining the highest possible degree of closeness to the real heritage entity itself to ensure scientific value. 


## The need for heritage documentation conservation

The heritage conservation regime does not merely end at documentation, which is but the first step. This must be mandatorily followed by measures to conserve this heritage documentation itself. However, most conservation agencies only focus on the documentation without giving much forethought to the way this documentation is managed, stored, and conserved. 

The need for heritage documentation conservation has become even more important in the modern world where several diverse and complex factors ranging from terrorism to climate change can continuously threaten and alter the state of heritage entities. Documentation then remains the only surviving ‘snapshot’ of the heritage entity as it once existed. The further loss of this documentation on account of the absence of preservation mechanisms or the insufficiency of those deployed can have fatal consequences for universal heritage. 


## The proposed heritage documentation conservation approach: documentation storage on a system of human and anthropogenic networks with decentralization and redundancy 

Heritage conservation agencies, governments, NGOs, individuals, and other stakeholders could adopt the proposed heritage documentation conservation approach that relies on a system comprising of networks which are both human-made and human-constituted in nature. The system uses the principles of decentralization and redundancy.

### The need for the storage of documentation on diverse networks and the decentralization of information

The fundamental proposition is that heritage documentation should be stored/retained on as many diverse networks as possible; the term ‘networks’ here refers to a chain of elements linked together either in space or time. Anthropogenic (human-made) networks include technologies such as the internet where computing devices across space are linked together. Human networks, on the other hand, is the term that is used here for oral traditions like the srutis in India which were verbally transmitted from one generation to the next. The result was a chain of humans linked in time, spanning generations. The use of decentralization (relinquishment of any central control) and redundancy (duplication of information across the network) in the resulting system of networks is important to ensure information (documentation) remains available, accessible, secure, and open. When as many networks as possible store data in the system,  network downtime and information inaccessibility are greatly reduced. This is exactly what the proposed system of networks aims to achieve. 

### Anthropogenic networks 

Considering anthropogenic networks such as the internet first, heritage documentation records are proposed to be stored in a decentralized manner wherein any central control on these records by any agency (governments, NGOs, museums, web servers, etc) will be relinquished. They will be copied on as many platforms/services/server systems and networks (such as IPFS and diverse blockchains) across the internet as possible to prevent the centralization of storage and access. 

Decentralization would entail the storage of heritage documentation on as many web servers and networks as possible rather than being confined to a single URL. This will ensure access to the documentation at all times since the unavailability of the record on one node will be mitigated by its availability on another one. It is proposed to use as many and diverse networks, servers, and systems as possible including social media, video and photo sharing websites, IPFS networks, blockchains, and even dedicated archival servers such as archive.org, etc to name just a few to store heritage documentation. Thus, what is proposed is a giant system of networks that is as decentralized and redundant as possible with several individual networks which are different by design. Decentralization ensures no central agency or network can deny/control access to the heritage documentation which should be a joint asset with universal ownership. Redundancy of information ensures the integrity, availablity, and security of documentation.

### Protocol decentralization

Furthermore, it is also important to be wary and stay clear of what might be called ‘protocol centralization’ which means we cannot rely on any single architecture or protocol (like any peer-to-peer models such as IPFS or client-server models) but true ‘decentralization’ in the real sense is one which is free of the ‘centralization’ of decentralizing protocols or mechanisms as well. The proposed approach, therefore, recommends not confining documentation storage to any particular protocol, even if it is a traditional ‘decentralized’ protocol (such as IPFS) itself thus ensuring protocol decentralization. The documentation should be stored on as many networks and systems running as many diverse protocols as possible for greater resilience and information accessibility. 

We might call the conventional/traditional ‘decentralized networks’ as we know them today (such as IPFS-based networks of nodes or blockchain networks) ’partially decentralized networks’, owing to the reliance of such a network on a single ‘centralized’ protocol that defines it. Complete decentralization is only possible when as many nodes, entities or networks are used (irrespective of which individual protocols these adhere to themselves– the key is to use as many varied and diverse networks as possible together to replicate information across the system) without them being interfaced or connected together. 

Current partially decentralized networks such as IPFS often struggle with slow access times for resources that are infrequently accessed and thus not cached. In contrast, the centralized client-server model is faster and more consistent in terms of ensuring access to resources requested by the client. The use of a truly decentralized system of networks made up of both (centralized) remote servers and partially decentralized networks (such as IPFS and blockchains) ensures much greater likelihood of access to the resources requested (and in a shorter time) since the documentation is stored across as many networks (all running on varied protocols) as possible rather than relying on a network running a single protocol/architecture. 

Documentation on anthropogenic networks such as the internet would be stored on both distributed and non-distributed networks. While the former refers to a network of multiple connected nodes that can share data and work collaboratively, particularly applying to peer to peer networks and IPFS (Inter Planetary File System), the latter refers to conventional web resource storage platforms such as video sharing servers (YouTube, Vimeo, etc) and social media platforms. The use of both distributed and non-distributed computing networks will add another element of decentralization into the system. 

### Redundancy in anthropogenic networks 

Documentation stored on the anthropogenic networks will need to follow redundancy so that it is replicated across servers, nodes or peers. This would ensure that there would be no single point of failure or device storing heritage documentation as all records will be distributed across the network/networks on as many nodes/servers/devices as possible. 

The internet, it might be noted, is just one example of an anthropogenic network currently used. As more human-made networks are deployed in the future, the approach recommends using those too in a bid to improve decentralization of power and increase the degree of redundancy of information. It is proposed that as many anthropogenic networks as possible be employed. The aim is to ensure efficient implementation of decentralization of access and redundancy of information across the entire system of networks. 

### Techniques for the use of anthropogenic networks in heritage documentation conservation 

- The proposed approach involves organizations, governments, agencies, and individuals across the world uploading documentation on diverse anthropogenic networks themselves (IPFS, blockchain, servers, social media platforms, archival web servers, video and photo sharing websites, etc to name a few)
- In addition to this, the general public needs to be able to contribute their heritage documentation (in the form of pictures, videos, and stories collected in the course of travels, for instance) to the global heritage documentation system of networks. For this, dedicated and/or relevant/appropriate hashtags on social media could be used while uploading content pertaining to heritage entities. Such hashtags need to be regularly scanned post which the public contributed content could be moderated and added to the networks with decentralization and redundancy measures in force. 
- It is thus important to use popular and contemporary social media networks such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and all others since those members of the general public who wish to contribute to the repository of heritage documentation need nothing more than their (pre-existing) social media accounts without having to sign up anywhere on a new platform. This would help make the proposed system of networks much more accessible and inclusion-friendly. Social media platforms are an integral part of our daily lives and are a part of the ‘moment’ (with an ‘always on’ functionality) which makes them great candidates for the storage of information (including heritage documentation) quickly and efficiently.
- The use of social media platforms in the system of networks is also beneficial considering their wider adoption, reach, and popularity. They are already used by millions of people around the world which makes them the ideal components of the proposed heritage documentation storage system of networks. 
- The massive heritage-related data on the internet and other anthropogenic networks will be a subset of the big data universe. The use of data scraping tools can help detect and collect all heritage and documentation related data online and add it to the system of networks after data processing and analysis. 
- In addition to scraping for heritage documentation and related entities, it is also important to capture what might be called the associated ‘metadata’ which will include anecdotes, stories, legends, lore, personal/collective experiences, observations, discussions, reviews, etc of the general public/communities/groups pertaining to the heritage entities. This metadata will itself prove an invaluable source of information for heritage conservation at large. This is on account of two major reasons. Firstly, such metadata can have vital clues related to the historical origins of the pertinent heritage entities and it is thus important to preserve them. Such metadata is often overlooked during heritage documentation which only focuses on the aspects perceived as ‘scientifically’, ‘historically’ or ‘archaeologically’ significant. On the contrary, such metadata constitutes the multitude of stories inherent in our heritage which must all be documented and conserved rather than selectively preserving a subset of documentation that the heritage professional, official or concerned individual or group deems ’important’. It is important to realize that the mathematical documentation set can never be too complete. The more comprehensive the documentation set with as diverse data as possible, the better. Secondly, such metadata adds to the emotional value associated with a heritage entity which is one of the main value propositions when it comes to raising mass awareness about heritage conservation and the sensitization of laypersons and communities. Such metadata and local histories, legends, and folklore are an important subset of heritage documentation and must be treated and conserved with that in mind. Such a subset is also one of the most important to conserve considering the profound emotional impact it has on the local and global communities. 

### Stories-based Architecture, Apps, and Web Portals

It is also proposed that individuals and organizations globally document stories and 'metadata' and share it with others on the worldwide network. Once again, in a bid to implement decentralization and redundancy in accordance with the core principles of this proposed framework of the heritage documentation conservation system of networks, it is imperative for all data uploaded to be decentralized and duplicated on other networks. It is this data that can be called ‘stories’. Even new ‘Stories’ apps amd web portals which allow users to upload their stories and then decentralize and duplicate these stories must be developed. Such apps and portals could be great places for people to discover great stories and upload their own. However, it might be stressed that such apps and web portals are but one part of the proposed system of networks and should be used in conjunction with the existing social media platforms and others. In no way is the intent to store the stories on only isolated new apps and servers. The principles of decentralization and redundancy apply. 

#### The Stories App & Its Architecture 

The new 'Stories' app and web portal would be an intuitive application with a clean UI. At the heart of the app would be a 'recording unit' which would allow users to record their 'stories' of cultures, archaeological objects, and heritage entities around them. They could record themselves telling stories that matter or document someone else recalling narratives. The app could be used to document heritage entities and their current state as well as the local lore, personal experiences, folklore, legends, myths, stories, anecdotes, reviews, observations, and beliefs surrounding the heritage entities concerned. The 'storoes' captured would thus form critical documentation which could take the form of any of the following: text, video, still images, sketches, graphics or audio. The user could write something about a heritage entity, draw a caricature to make a point, record an audio story as narrated by the locals or themselves, capture a video recording or take still photos to illustrate his/her story. 

Once the recording unit would record the requisite, the user could then proceed to the upload interface where he could add any text, location information, and other such vitals before posting the recording (video/audio/still images/text/graphics/sketches).

At this point, the upload engine would upload the documentation on the 'Stories' app servers as well as use APIs to upload it to all accessible social media platforms via the 'Stories' app official accounts (such a Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc) as well as on the archival platforms (such as archive.org). The larger the number of such media storage, social media, media sharing, and archival platforms the documentation is uploaded to, the better. 

A third component of the Stories App would be the curation engine. The curation engine would have data scrapers that would scan the web for any 'stories' uploaded on any of the platforms. It would scan certain relevant hashtags used on social media and other platforms as well as photo and video sharing websites and blogs and also use scraping techniques to gather relevant stories and upload them on the Stories App.

Users could see each others 'stories' and like, share, and comment. They could follow each others' accounts on the app just like the common social media apps. 

#### The Primary Aim of the Stories App 
It is strongly intended to make the Stories App the one-step and highly sought-after place for people across the world who are curious to know the 'stories' behind everything. 

These stories would also help provide the heritage entities global and local exposure and help drive tourism and development as well. 


### Human networks

Furthermore, the proposed approach and system of networks also involves the use of what are called ‘human networks’. The term here refers to a network of human memories linked across generations (time). Folk and collective memories, for instance, are an appropriate example, as are the oral traditions such as the ancient Indian srutis (oral texts) which were passed down generations to a high degree of precision. What is intended here is to incorporate the documentation of heritage entities (in the form of the multitude of narratives, stories, metadata, and other elements) into the human network, the human collective memory. This will ensure that it can be transmitted through millennia even in the absence of technological devices. The Indian srutis have been transmitted for millennia to a remarkable degree of accuracy exactly this way. This is a time-tested approach to conservation.

The human network is itself of several different types and the proposed methodology involves using as many and diverse human networks as possible to once again ensure: decentralization (relinquishment of single-point control and access) and redundancy (duplication of documentation across human memories). Human memory can be either individual or collective (community memory). 

### Individual memory networks

Individual memory networks would entail select individuals or groups of individuals passing down ‘memories’ or impressions of heritage documentation from one generation to the next. This is similar to the traditional Guru-Shishya parampara or the teacher-student tradition which is still used in the teaching of the classical arts such as dance and music in India. Information is passed on from the teacher to the disciple in an oral or intangible form without being written down. This is also how the Vedas were orally transmitted in ancient India. 

It is thus important to connect heritage (both local and global) with the everyday lives of identified individuals who hold the promise of imbibing this legacy into their memories and can pass them on or recall/reproduce them when and as often needed. Such individuals can be located either in the geo-vicinity of such heritage entities or elsewhere. 

### Collective or community networks 

Collective or community networks, on the other hand, pertain to the community memories associated with a large group of people. This includes folk traditions, for instance. Stories and legends have been passed down throughout history in the form of dances, folk songs, festivals, customs, traditions, religious ceremonies, and practices. 

It is imperative to imbibe heritage and heritage documentation in the community folk memory so it occupies a space in the cultural fabric. Without these memory inculcation techniques, heritage will eventually become a disconnected entity separated from the fabric of culture and everyday life. When this happens, it has a disastrous effect— impoverishing communities and individuals of their ancient history while also taking away a sense of who they are: their very identities. It is important for local communities which reside in the geo-vicinity of the heritage entities to be a part of the proposed human network which forms a part of the larger system of networks. However, community sensitization and inculcation into the network should also be carried out for other communities as well who are not in the geo-vicinity of heritage entities, although communities residing in the proximity of a heritage entity will relate to and appreciate its importance, narratives, and elements much more. Heritage entities will benefit from inclusion in both individual and community folk memories of local as well as global populations. 

### Techniques for the use of human networks in heritage documentation conservation 

It is also important to consider the nature of this inculcation of heritage documentation into the individual and community human networks. 

- What is intended here is to make heritage entities a very part and parcel of everyday life. If the individual or the community retains these impressions of our heritage (which serves as a form of documentation considering the nature of human memory) in their memories and passes them on, it is for one simple reason: these should have an important bearing on their lives or have valuable lessons to teach. This is largely how folk stories, traditions, arts, and practices have survived millennia. 
- It is imperative to explore the right techniques to catalyze the ‘storage’ of documentation narratives in human networks. This could include film and audio-visual media screenings for individuals, communities, schoolchildren, and the youth which can help facilitate the process of inculcation of heritage in human memory.
- Furthermore, activities that engage including storytelling and interactive sessions, games, and quizzes can also play a pivotal role in shaping individual and collective/community memory. 
- It is important to use the collected metadata as described earlier (including but not limited to anecdotes, legends, lores, stories, personal/group experiences, observations, reviews, discussions, etc) since this information is often enriched with a unique emotional value that forms the value proposition when it comes to raising awareness about the respective heritage entities among the masses.


## The Decentralized and Redundant Indexing Mechanism 

One of the most important aspects of the proposed system of networks conserving heritage documentation will be an indexing mechanism. All information present everywhere will be indexed. The indices will keep a record of all documentation. This will ensure the presence of databases which would track and point to documentation records. Without such indices, it will be extremely difficult to locate and access the desired documentation. 

### Decentralized Indexing

The index too will be stored on the system of networks in a decentralized and redundant manner for the same reasons: this will ensure there is no single point of failure and control while duplicating data on as many human and anthropogenic nodes as possible. 

### Use of Blockchain and DLT Networks 

Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) networks should be used to store the indices too: with their inherent immutability and transparency, they will present several advantages to the indexing mechanism. This does not, however, mean that the indices should be stored only on blockchain or DLT networks. They should be stored on as many and diverse networks as possible much like the system of networks for heritage documentation storage. 

### Multiplicity of Indices and Two-fold Redundancy 

It is recommended to maintain multiple indices: every agency, governmental department, museum, research institution, etc should maintain its index on a system of networks. This ensures two-fold redundancy: while different agencies maintain their own varied indices as per their specific mandates and objectives (level one of redundancy), each of these agency indices will be stored in a decentralized and redundant manner, copied on as many networks as possible (level two of redundancy) of the system of networks. 

A consequence of this two-fold redundancy would be an overlap between the indices. In other words, the mathematical index sets will not be disjoint as they will have elements in common. 



## Properties of the Proposed Heritage Documentation System of Networks 

### System of Networks With Decentralization and Redundancy 

The proposed heritage documentation methodology proposes the use of multiple networks (the resultant entity is a giant system made up of multiple networks. These networks are not interfaced/connected with each other but may be constituted of connected nodes themselves. Furthermore, the networks are made of human as well as anthropogenic components). Heritage documentation stored on the system of networks will thus be completely decentralized with no single node or network controlling access. All documentation will be duplicated across the network to maintain the highest achievable degree of redundancy. The ideal approach to archiving is the use of multiple networks for the storage of the records. A combination of both centralized and what are being referred to as ‘partially decentralized’ networks needs to be used for the safest possible archiving that can withstand the test of time. 

The result will be a system of networks that has complete (and not partial) decentralization and redundancy enforced by design. 

### Future Ready, All Inclusive, and Ever Expanding System of Networks 

It is not proposed to create a whole new network/platform (such as a new blockchain or IPFS-based system) and inviting users to submit heritage content there. The open structure of the proposed ‘system of networks’ will never get outdated since, by its very design, it will keep assimilating and utilizing new technologies and create decentralized and redundant backups of heritage documentation on any new protocols or networks as and when these are introduced/invented. This is because new anthropogenic networks would be constantly used to store documentation for increased decentralization and redundancy.

### Eternalizing Heritage 

Documentation, it might be noted, is the only real and feasible way of protecting and ‘eternalizing’ heritage. This is because the right documentation media can be as close as possible to the real-world heritage entities in terms of mimicking them and their attributes. The documentation obtained can then be reproduced as and when needed. This will effectively be as close as we can currently get to ensuring the immortality and change-resistance/management of heritage entities as possible. 

### Indexed System with Decentralization and Two-fold Redundancy 
All information on the system of networks will be indexed. This will ensure ease of access and querying the documentation records for specific heritage entities and sites, for instance. The index, like the documentation records, will also be stored in a decentralized and redundant manner in a system of networks. Furthermore, several different types of indices must be maintained by different agencies and organizations to ensure two-fold redundancy. 

## Conclusion

A multi-fold approach is thus proposed here wherein heritage documentation will be stored on a system comprising of multiple networks (both uninterfaced/unconnected human networks and uninterfaced/unconnected anthropogenic networks) rather than being stored on a single network. 

These networks should be as varied and diverse (running diverse protocols) as possible with an unhindered focus on the decentralization and redundancy of the stored documentation to ensure that the records are always available with minimal downtime and there are no limited points of failure with documentation being available on diverse human and anthropogenic networks. A decentralized and redundant indexing system will ensure that the documentation is easily accessible and traceable when needed.
